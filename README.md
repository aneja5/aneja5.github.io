## Overview
This repository contains my personal website created as part of my web development assignment. The website showcases my academic and professional journey, projects, and interests.

## Assignment Reflection

### What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?
The most challenging aspect of this assignment was ensuring that the website was both aesthetically pleasing and functional across various devices. I faced particular difficulties with mobile responsiveness and making sure all elements scaled properly without compromising the design. Debugging CSS issues also took more time than I anticipated.

### Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?
I found working with HTML relatively straightforward since it focuses on structure. However, CSS posed more of a challenge due to its intricacies in styling elements, creating layouts, and managing responsive design. Understanding the box model and properly utilizing flexbox and grid systems was crucial but took some experimentation.

### How long did this overall assignment take you?
Overall, I spent approximately **15 hours** on this assignment. This includes planning, coding, testing, and debugging.

### What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile-friendly?
To make the site mobile-friendly, I utilized CSS media queries to adjust styles for different screen sizes. I also opted for a responsive grid layout for content presentation and ensured that images and text scaled appropriately. Additionally, I prioritized touch-friendly navigation and larger clickable areas for buttons and links to enhance user experience on mobile devices.

### What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?
When developing the design of my website, I focused on user experience and accessibility. I chose a clean and simple layout with a consistent color scheme to make navigation intuitive. I considered typography for readability and ensured that the contrast between text and background was sufficient. The goal was to create a visually appealing yet functional design that effectively communicates my background and projects.

### Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?
I am particularly proud of the seamless integration of my projects and blog sections, which allow users to easily navigate through my work and thoughts. Additionally, I am happy with the overall responsiveness of the website, which provides a consistent experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future?
If given more time or resources, I would consider adding the following features:
- A more interactive contact form to allow visitors to reach out directly through the site.
- An interactive portfolio section with project demonstrations.
- A blog commenting system for user engagement.
- Advanced CSS animations for improved visual appeal.

### How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
I dedicated approximately **18 hours** to this assignment.

### (Optional) If you made any assumptions about this assignment, what are they?
I assumed that basic knowledge of HTML and CSS would be sufficient for completing the assignment. I also assumed that users would primarily access the website on mobile devices, which influenced my design choices for mobile responsiveness.

## Conclusion
This assignment was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to apply my knowledge of web development principles. I look forward to enhancing this site further and incorporating more features in the future.
