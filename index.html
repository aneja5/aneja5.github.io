            <p>Welcome to my personal website! I’m <span class="highlight">Sahilpreet Aneja</span>, a driven engineer passionate about combining mechanical and computer science skills to create innovative solutions. My academic journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology (TIET), where I honed my expertise in robotics, control systems, and embedded systems. Now, I’m expanding my knowledge further as I pursue a Master of Science in Computer Science at Northeastern University, with an expected graduation in May 2026.</p>
                    
            <p>During my academic career, I’ve had the opportunity to work on several impactful projects, including developing a <span class="highlight">Ride-Sharing Driver Validation System</span> using Java and designing a <span class="highlight">Self-Posture Correcting Chair</span> utilizing CAD and MATLAB simulations. My hands-on experience spans from creating software systems to designing mechanical components, giving me a unique perspective on how to integrate hardware and software seamlessly.</p>
            
            <p>Professionally, I’ve gained valuable experience as an Assistant Manager at Hero MotoCorp, where I led a team in digitizing maintenance systems and integrating IoT sensors to reduce downtime by 25%. My ability to analyze workflows and implement process improvements also helped in reducing energy consumption significantly. I’ve been fortunate to apply my skills to real-world problems and contribute to large-scale operations in the industry.</p>

            <p>I’m proficient in several programming languages, including Java, Python, C++, and SQL, and I regularly use tools such as MATLAB, SOLIDWORKS, Ansys, and various integrated development environments like Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA. I am passionate about working on cutting-edge technologies that push the boundaries of what’s possible, especially in robotics and automation.</p>
            
            <p>Beyond my technical pursuits, I am also an avid traveler who loves exploring new places and cultures. Traveling has broadened my worldview, inspired my creativity, and given me a fresh perspective on solving problems.</p>

            <p>Feel free to explore more about my <a href="projects.html">projects</a>, <a href="blog.html">read my blog</a>, or <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a>. I'm excited to share my journey and look forward to connecting with you!</p>
